    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Uh oh, it looks like it may not be magic after all. It seems to require a makefile. But what is a makefile? A makefile is just a plain-text file that obeys certain formatting rules. Its purpose is to supply the make utility with a full definition of the dependency tree describing the relationships between files and tasks. The makefile also describes the steps for updating each file based on the others (i.e., which commands must be executed to update\n",
    "one of the nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the make command is run with no arguments, then the make utility seeks a file called Makefile in the current directory to fulfill this purpose. The error response occurs because you have not yet created a Makefile in the directory where you hold your analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "### If the makefile has any name other than Makefile, its name must be\n",
    "provided explicitly. The -f flag indicates the location of that file to\n",
    "the make utility. Makefiles with names other than Makefile are typically\n",
    "only necessary if more than one makefile must exist in a single\n",
    "directory. By convention, makefiles not called Makefile end in\n",
    "the .mk extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will discuss how to write makefiles by hand. Such makefiles can be used\n",
    "to automate simple analysis and software pipelines. Prof. Mayer will create one to\n",
    "update the plots in her paper based on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Targets\n",
    "First and foremost, the makefile defines targets. Targets are the nodes of the dependency\n",
    "tree. They are typically the files that are being updated. The makefile is made up\n",
    "mostly of a series of target-prerequisite-action maps defined in the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "target : prerequisites\n",
    "         action\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A colon separates the target name from the list of prerequisites.\n",
    "Note that the action must be preceded by a single tab character.\n",
    "The analyzed .dat files depend on the raw .h5 files in the raw_data directory. They\n",
    "also depend on the bash scripts that churn through the .h5 files to convert them into\n",
    "useful .dat files. Therefore, the photon_photon.dat target depends on two prerequisites,\n",
    "the set of ./raw_data/*.h5 files and the photon_analysis.sh shell script.\n",
    "Let us imagine the shell script is quite clever, having been written by Prof. Mayer herself.\n",
    "It has been written to generically model various interactions and accepts arguments\n",
    "at runtime that modify its behavior. One of the arguments it accepts is the\n",
    "number of photons involved in the interaction. Since the photon_photon.dat file\n",
    "describes the two-photon interaction, the shell script can be modified with the special\n",
    "flag -n=2 indicating the number of photons. The following definition in a makefile\n",
    "sets up the target with its prerequisites and passes in this argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Building the Shell Model Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "photon_photon.dat : photon_analysis.sh ./raw_data/*.h5\n",
    "./photon_analysis.sh -n=2 > photon_photon.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The target file to be created or updated is the photon_photon.dat file. The prerequisites\n",
    "(the files on which it depends) are the shell script and the .h5 files.\n",
    "This command is the action that must be taken to update the target using the\n",
    "prerequisites.\n",
    "338 | Chapter 14: Building Pipelines and Software\n",
    "In this example, the first line is a comment describing the file. That’s just good practice\n",
    "and does not affect the behavior of the makefile. The second line describes the\n",
    "target and the prerequisites, and the third line describes the action that must be taken\n",
    "to update photon_photon.dat in the event that make detects any changes to either of\n",
    "its prerequisites.\n",
    "If this source code is saved in a file called Makefile, then it will be found when make is\n",
    "executed.\n",
    "Exercise: Create a Makefile\n",
    "1. In the make directory of the files associated with this book,\n",
    "create an empty file called Makefile.\n",
    "2. Add the photon_photon.dat target as described.\n",
    "3. Save the file.\n",
    "Now that the makefile defines a target, it can be used to update that target. To build or\n",
    "update a target file using make, you must call it with the name of the target defined in\n",
    "the makefile. In this case, if make photon_photon.dat is called, then make will:\n",
    "1. Check the status of the prerequisites and photon_photon.dat.\n",
    "2. If their timestamps do not match, it will execute the action.\n",
    "3. However, if their timestamps do match, nothing will happen, because everything\n",
    "is up to date already.\n",
    "The makefile is built up of many such target-prerequisite-action maps. The full\n",
    "dependency tree can accordingly be built from a set of these directives. The next node\n",
    "Prof. Mayer might define, for example, is the one that rebuilds Figure 4 any time the\n",
    "photon_photon.dat file is changed. That figure is generated by the plot_response.py\n",
    "Python script, so any changes to that script should also trigger a rebuild of fig4.svg.\n",
    "The makefile grows accordingly as each target definition is added. The new version\n",
    "might look like this:\n",
    "# Building the Shell Model Paper\n",
    "photon_photon.dat : photon_analysis.sh ./raw_data/*.h5\n",
    "./photon_analysis.sh -n=2 > photon_photon.dat\n",
    "fig4.svg : photon_photon.dat plot_response.py\n",
    "python plot_dat.py --input=photon_photon.dat --output=fig4.svg\n",
    "A new target, fig4.svg, is defined.\n",
    "make | 339\n",
    "The fig4.svg file depends on photon_photon.dat as a prerequisite (as well as a\n",
    "Python script, plot_response.py).\n",
    "The action to build fig4.svg executes the Python script with specific options.\n",
    "Since the figure relies on photon_photon.dat as a prerequisite, it also, in turn, relies on\n",
    "prerequisites of photon_photon.dat. In this way, the dependency tree is made. So,\n",
    "when make fig4.svg is called, make ensures that all the prerequisites of its prerequisites\n",
    "are up to date.\n",
    "Exercise: Add Additional Targets\n",
    "1. Open the Makefile created in the previous exercise.\n",
    "2. Add the fig4.svg target as above.\n",
    "3. Can you tell, from Figure 14-1, how to add other targets? Try\n",
    "adding some.\n",
    "4. Save the file.\n",
    "The final paper depends on all of the figures and the .tex files. So, any time a figure or\n",
    "the .tex files change, the LaTeX commands must be reissued. The LaTeX program will\n",
    "be covered in much greater detail in Chapter 20. At that time, you may combine your\n",
    "knowledge of make with your knowledge of LaTeX to determine what targets should\n",
    "be included in a makefile for generating a LaTeX-based document.\n",
    "Special Targets\n",
    "The first target in a file is usually run by default. That target is the one that is built\n",
    "when make is called with no arguments. Often, the desired default behavior is to\n",
    "update everything. An “all” target is a common convention for this. Note that the target\n",
    "name does not have to be identical to the filename. It can be any word that is convenient.\n",
    "The “all” target simply needs to depend on all other top-level targets.\n",
    "In the case of Prof. Mayer’s paper, the all target might be defined using the wildcard\n",
    "character (*):\n",
    "# Building the Shell Model Paper\n",
    "all: figure*.svg *.dat *.tex *.pdf\n",
    "photon_photon.dat : photon_analysis.sh ./raw_data/*.h5\n",
    "./photon_analysis.sh -n=2 > photon_photon.dat\n",
    "fig4.svg : photon_photon.dat\n",
    "python plot_response.py --input=photon_photon.dat --output=fig4.svg\n",
    "340 | Chapter 14: Building Pipelines and Software\n",
    "...\n",
    "Note how the all target does not define an action. It just collects prerequisites.\n",
    "The all target tells make to do exactly what is needed. That is, when this target is\n",
    "called (with make or make all), make ensures that all prerequisites are up to date, but\n",
    "performs no final action.\n",
    "Exercise: Create a Special Target\n",
    "Another common special target is clean. This target is typically\n",
    "used to delete generated files in order to trigger a fresh reupdate of\n",
    "everything.\n",
    "1. Open the Makefile you have been working with.\n",
    "2. Create a “clean” target.\n",
    "3. What are the appropriate prerequisites? Are there any?\n",
    "4. What is the appropriate command to delete the auxiliary files\n",
    "created by LaTeX?\n",
    "Now that she knows how to create a makefile, Prof. Mayer can use it to manage\n",
    "dependencies for the entire process of building her paper from the raw data. This is a\n",
    "common use for makefiles and facilitates many parts of analysis, visualization, and\n",
    "publication. Another common use for makefiles is configuring, compiling, building,\n",
    "linking, and installing software libraries. The next section will cover many aspects of\n",
    "this kind of makefile.\n",
    "Building and Installing Software\n",
    "Python is called a compiled language because it does not need to be compiled. That is,\n",
    "Python is precompiled. However, that compilation step is not handled so nicely by all\n",
    "programming languages. C, C++ , Fortran, Java, and many others require multiple\n",
    "stages of building before they are ready to run. We said in the introduction to this\n",
    "chapter that these stages were:\n",
    "1. Configuration\n",
    "2. Compilation\n",
    "3. Linking\n",
    "4. Installation\n",
    "Building and Installing Software | 341\n",
    "From a user’s perspective, this maps onto the following set of commands for installing\n",
    "software from source :\n",
    "~ $ .configure [options]\n",
    "~ $ make [options]\n",
    "~ $ make test\n",
    "~ $ [sudo] make install\n",
    "The configuration step may be called with a different command (i.e., ccmake or\n",
    "scons). This step creates a makefile based on user options and system characteristics.\n",
    "The build step compiles the source code into binary format and incorporates file\n",
    "path links to the libraries on which it depends.\n",
    "Before installing, it is wise to execute the test target, if available, to ensure that\n",
    "the library has built successfully on your platform.\n",
    "The installation step will copy the build files into an appropriate location on your\n",
    "computer. Often, this may be a location specified by the user in the configuration\n",
    "step. If the install directory requires super-user permissions, it may be necessary\n",
    "to prepend this command with sudo, which changes your role during this action\n",
    "to the super-user role.\n",
    "For installation to succeed, each of these steps requires commands, flags, and customization\n",
    "specific to the computer platform, the user, and the environment. That is, the\n",
    "“action” defined by the makefile may involve commands that should be executed differently\n",
    "on different platforms or for different users.\n",
    "For example, a compilation step can only use the compiler available on the computer.\n",
    "Compilation is done with a command of the form:\n",
    "compiler [options] <source files> <include files> [-l linked libraries]\n",
    "For C++ programs, one user may use g++ while another uses clang and a third uses\n",
    "gcc. The appropriate command will be different for each user. The makefile, therefore,\n",
    "must be configured to detect which compiler exists on the machine and to adjust the\n",
    "“action” accordingly. That is, in the action for the compilation step, the compiler command\n",
    "and its arguments are not known a priori. Configuration, Compilation, Linking,\n",
    "and Installation depend on the computer environment, user preferences, and\n",
    "many other factors.\n",
    "For this reason, when you are building and installing software libraries, makefiles can\n",
    "become very complex. However, at their core, their operation is no different than for\n",
    "simple analysis pipeline applications like the one in the previous section. As the\n",
    "dependency tree grows, more targets are added, and the actions become more com‐\n",
    "342 | Chapter 14: Building Pipelines and Software\n",
    "plex or system-dependent, more advanced makefile syntax and platform-specific configuration\n",
    "becomes necessary. Automation is the only solution that scales.\n",
    "Configuration of the Makefile\n",
    "It would be tedious and error-prone to write a custom makefile appropriate for each\n",
    "conceivable platform-dependent combination of variables. To avoid this tedium, the\n",
    "most effective researchers and software developers choose to utilize tools that automate\n",
    "that configuration. These tools:\n",
    "• Detect platform and architecture characteristics\n",
    "• Detect environment variables\n",
    "• Detect available commands, compilers, and libraries\n",
    "• Accept user input\n",
    "• Produce a customized makefile\n",
    "In this way, configuration tools (a.k.a. “build systems”) address all aspects of the\n",
    "project that may be variable in the build phase. Additionally, they enable the developer\n",
    "to supply sensible default values for each parameter, which can be coupled with\n",
    "methods to override those defaults when necessary.\n",
    "Why Not Write Your Own Installation Makefile?\n",
    "Writing your own makefile from scratch can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n",
    "Furthermore, as a software project is adopted by a diversity of users and scales to\n",
    "include dependencies on external libraries, generating an appropriate array of makefiles\n",
    "for each use case becomes untenable. So, the makefile should be generated by a\n",
    "sophisticated build system, which will enable it to be much more flexible across platforms\n",
    "than would otherwise be possible.\n",
    "Some common build system automation tools in scientific computing include:\n",
    "• CMake\n",
    "• Autotools (Automake + Autoconf)\n",
    "• SCons\n",
    "Rather than demonstrating the syntax of each of these tools, the following sections\n",
    "will touch on shared concepts among them and the configurations with which they\n",
    "assist.\n",
    "First among these, most build systems enable customization based on the computer\n",
    "system platform and architecture.\n",
    "Building and Installing Software | 343\n",
    "Platform configuration\n",
    "Users have various computer platforms with similarly various architectures. Most\n",
    "software must be built differently on each. Even the very simplest things can vary\n",
    "across platforms. For example, libraries have different filename extensions on each\n",
    "platform (perhaps libSuperPhysics.dll on Windows, libSuperPhysics.so on Linux, and\n",
    "libSuperPhysics.dyld on Unix). Thus, to define the makefile targets, prerequisites, and\n",
    "actions, the configuration system must detect the platform. The operating system\n",
    "may be any of the following, and more:\n",
    "• Linux\n",
    "• Unix\n",
    "• Windows\n",
    "• Mobile\n",
    "• Embedded\n",
    "Additionally, different computer architectures store numbers differently. For example,\n",
    "on 32-bit machines, the processors store integers in 32-bit-sized memory blocks.\n",
    "However, on a 64-bit machine, an integer is stored with higher precision (64 bits).\n",
    "Differences like this require that the configuration system detect how the current\n",
    "architecture stores numbers. These specifications often must be included in the compilation\n",
    "command.\n",
    "Beyond the platform and architecture customizations that must be made, the system\n",
    "environment, what libraries are installed, the locations of those libraries, and other\n",
    "user options also affect the build.\n",
    "System and user configuration\n",
    "Most importantly, different computers are controlled by different users. Thus, build\n",
    "systems must accommodate users who make different choices with regard to issues\n",
    "such as:\n",
    "• What compiler to use\n",
    "• What versions of libraries to install\n",
    "• Where to install those libraries\n",
    "• What directories to include in their PATH and similar environment variables\n",
    "• What optional parts of the project to build\n",
    "• What compiler flags to use (debugging build, optimized build, etc.)\n",
    "The aspects of various systems that cause the most trouble when you’re installing a\n",
    "new library are the environment variables (such as PATH) and their relationship to the\n",
    "344 | Chapter 14: Building Pipelines and Software\n",
    "locations of installed libraries. In particular, when this relationship is not precise and\n",
    "accurate, the build system can struggle to find and link dependencies.\n",
    "Dependency configuration\n",
    "When one piece of software depends on the functionality of another piece of software,\n",
    "the second is called a dependency. For example, if the SuperPhysics library\n",
    "relies on the EssentialPhysics library and the ExtraPhysics library, then they are\n",
    "its dependencies. Before attempting to install the SuperPhysics library, you must\n",
    "install EssentialPhysics and ExtraPhysics.\n",
    "The build can fail in either of these cases:\n",
    "• The build system cannot locate a dependency library.\n",
    "• The available library is not the correct version.\n",
    "The build system seeks the libraries listed in the PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and similar\n",
    "environment variables. Thus, the most common problems in building software arise\n",
    "when too many or not enough dependency libraries appear in the directories targetted\n",
    "by the environment.\n",
    "When too many versions of the ExtraPhysics library are found, for example, the\n",
    "wrong version of the library might be linked and an error may occur. At the other\n",
    "extreme, if no EssentialPhysics library is found, the build will certainly fail. To fix\n",
    "these problems, be sure all dependencies are appropriately installed.\n",
    "Once all dependencies, environment variables, user options, and other configurations\n",
    "are complete, a makefile or installation script is generated by the build system. The\n",
    "first action it conducts is the compilation step.\n",
    "Compilation\n",
    "Now that the makefile is configured, it can be used to compile the source code. The\n",
    "commands in the makefile for a software build will be mostly compiler commands.\n",
    "Without getting into too much detail, compilers are programs that turn source code\n",
    "into a machine-readable binary format.\n",
    "The build system, by convention, likely generated a makefile with a default target\n",
    "designed to compile all of the source code into a local directory. So, with a simple\n",
    "make command, the compiled files are generated and typically saved (by the makefile)\n",
    "in a temporary directory as a test before actual installation. Additionally, once compiled,\n",
    "the build can usually be tested with make test.\n",
    "If the tests pass, the build system can also assist with the next step: installation.\n",
    "Building and Installing Software | 345\n",
    "Installation\n",
    "As mentioned in Chapter 13, the key to attracting users to your project is making it\n",
    "installable.\n",
    "On Windows, this means creating a Setup.exe file. With Python, it means implementing\n",
    "a setup.py or other distribution utility. For other source code on Unix systems,\n",
    "this means generating a makefile with an install target so that make install can be\n",
    "called.\n",
    "Why not just write a simple script to perform the installation?\n",
    "The user may eventually want to upgrade or even uninstall your program, fantastic as\n",
    "it may be. By tradition, the installation program is usually created by the application\n",
    "developer, but the uninstall program is usually the responsibility of the operating system.\n",
    "On Windows, this is handled by the Add/Remove Programs tool. On Unix, this\n",
    "is the responsibility of the package manager. This means the installation program\n",
    "needs special platform-dependent capabilities, which are usually taken care of by the\n",
    "build system.\n",
    "For example, on Linux, make install is not used when creating packages. Instead,\n",
    "make DESTDIR=<a_fake_root_dir> install installs the package to a fake root directory.\n",
    "Then, a package is created from the fake root directory, and uninstallation is\n",
    "possible because a manifest is generated from the result.\n",
    "The build system will have created this target automatically. If the installation location\n",
